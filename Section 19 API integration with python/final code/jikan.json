Be aware that Tonikaku is much more comedic, while Otonari focuses more on the romance.",

I say that reservably; as Saiunkoku Monogatari can be interpreted and seen in a lens of a Chinese Imperial Era literature or even akin to Korean Joseon Period era literature. In this case, My Happy Marriage is set in a period akin to the Meiji Era. All play into the following important factors: They revolve around marriage arrangements that's serve as a means to deal with political and family-clan issues. Characters from both shows learn to deal with the tribulations of the broader picture and eventually grow fonder with one another. Romance can develop but is usually overshadowed by socio-political and external factors. Saiunkoku Monogatari is more lighthearted and more Shoujo (but doesn't shy away from serious dramatic storylines & political topics) whereas My Happy Marriage has more Josei undertones with a more serious and dramatic direction. If you like a romanticised Asian period type stories that doesn't feel like your typical anime; then these shows are perfect for you.",

Kai (Piano no Mori) was satisfied with playing piano for himself until his mentor shows him that there is so much more to learn from the piano. Minato (Tsurune) had resigned himself from never practicing archery again after losing his self-confidence. A chance encounter with his mentor inspires him to pick up archery again and begin recovering his confidence. These mentors do not simply teach, but challenge their students to find their own answers and discover new depth for their passions. As you can guess, both series focuses on character growth.",

They dont have similar characters but the similarity is that, just like vanitas no Karte has a unique world of vampires to itself, in pandora hearts there is a unique world of 'Chains'. Both have an immense amount of Angst and both are supernatural. A difference is Pandora hearts doesnt have a main love interest since the MC is only 15 (he does have a crush tho) and I suggest reading the manga after u finish the anime because it shows only the introduction to the whole thing",

Yuri is an aging figure skater with anxiety problems, but his new coach unlocks his artistry and confidence. They are also greatly shaped by their admiration for their rivals - Yuri Plisetsky (Yuri!!! on Ice) and Shuuhei Amamiya (Piano no Mori).

But all that glitters isn't gold in Vivy's and Psycho-Pass: Providence. Society struggles to stay attached at the thread, and even the most perfect member's of society struggle to balance their sanity and societal expectations of them. Really recommend both as the music and voice actors are absolutely excellent. The directing at some parts were very reminiscent of each other. And overall, if you'd like to ponder what like would be like 100 years from now, or if AIs ever took over the world-- these are both amazing series that tackle a lot of nuances issues.",

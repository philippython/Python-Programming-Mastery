# challenge 1: Factorial Calculator

# Write a Python function called factorial that calculates the factorial of a given number using a while loop. The factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. The factorial of 0 is defined to be 1.

# The function should have the following specifications:

# Name: factorial
# Parameters:
# n (integer): The number for which the factorial needs to be calculated.
# Return:
# result (integer): The factorial of the given number.
# You should use a while loop inside the function to calculate the factorial.


# Task 2: Create a simple game function, that takes no parameter and initiates the guessing game
# 1. The game should generate a random number between 1 and 100.
# 2. The player should be prompted to guess the number.
# 3. The game should provide feedback to the player after each guess, indicating whether the guess was too high or too low.
# 4. The player has 5 chances to get it right and whenever they guess wrong they lose a chance.
# 5. If the player guesses the correct number within the given attempts, they should be declared the winner.
# 6. If the player runs out of attempts without guessing the correct number, they should be declared the loser.

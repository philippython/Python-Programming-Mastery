# Create a class called "Person" with the following properties:
# - name (string)
# - age (integer)
# - occupation (string)
# The class should have a constructor that initializes these properties.

# Create two methods within the class:
# - introduce(): prints a message introducing the person with their name, age, and occupation.
# - change_occupation(new_occupation): updates the occupation of the person.

# Create two objects of the Person class and test the methods.
